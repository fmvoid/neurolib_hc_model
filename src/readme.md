1. Implement proper error handling:
   - Add try-except blocks for key operations (file I/O, simulation runs).
   - Log errors and warnings appropriately.

2. Add basic unit tests:
   - Create tests for critical functions (e.g., parameter loading, objective function).
   - Implement a simple test runner.

3. Implement a basic results management system:
   - Create a structured directory for saving results.
   - Implement methods to save and load optimization results.

4. Implement custom optimization loop that uses a different topology
5.
